    The heart of Peklo Tool is a smart technology that groups keywords. Performed manually, grouping can take an overwhelmingly long time. It gets virtually unmanageable if a planned contextual advertising campaign uses thousands or tens of thousands of keywords, which they often do.

    Automating the grouping process was challenging because human language was involved. All the possible spelling options (including typos) for keywords need to be considered. Normally, neural networks and natural language processing (NLP) technologies would be used to handle the linguistic variations. But with them, grouping would’ve been slow, so we found an alternative solution.

        NLP could cope with grouping, but it would’ve taken several minutes to process a single file with keywords in it

    Speed was a priority. We wanted to create a tool that could impress the user by grouping keywords instantly. By integrating the dictionaries, we achieved it. The grouping process takes Peklo Tool only a few seconds.
