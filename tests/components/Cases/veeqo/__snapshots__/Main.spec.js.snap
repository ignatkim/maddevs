        Dockerization is the most viable solution today to set up continuous delivery. As our application was back then partially hosted on Heroku, we created a unified runtime for developers and CI by dockerizing the main app using a Heroku Stack image and Docker Compose. It made CI reliable and allowed simplifying deployment. Also, it sped up bootstrapping of the development environment.

    Jenkins was operated manually on a separate EC2 instance. Managing it was thus challenging, especially in emergencies. We moved the Jenkins master to ECS by remaking its provisioning, deployment, and updating (Later, we’ll move it to k8s, but in 2017, ECS was the only good option for us). We reduced build time and cost by allocating a small part of compute resources of Jenkins agents to reserved instances and moving 90% of the load to spot instances.

    Kubernetes and the team were ready for each other. Kubernetes was growing stable, well-integrated with all the major AWS services, and well-equipped for high production loads. The team, in turn, stabilized the development processes and needed better automation. Kubernetes provided a unified platform for app launching and Docker containers orchestration: we wanted to have a unified platform to safeguard Veeqo’s future growth. Having one platform to handle everything meant being independent of cloud providers and being able to launch instances in any clouds. We were going more cloud agnostic: Kubernetes allows moving workloads seamlessly.

    There’s nothing more expensive than idle resources. At the same time, you don’t want to load the nodes to their maximum capacity because a) it’ll lead to performance degradation and b) you do need some idle resource to handle load spikes. Kubernetes finds balance.

    The balance is found based on thorough continuous calculations. Kubernetes shuffles services from node to node so that resources are not overused and creates optimal distribution that a human admin could never possibly achieve manually.

    Kubernetes and containerization

    Kubernetes specializes in resource management and orchestration, but it needs a containerization service alongside it. We used Docker to standardize the runtime for application. The two worked perfectly together.

    Kubernetes provides an environment where Ops and Devs can speak the same language: the language of YAML configurations and Kubernetes objects. We get system resources on one end, containers on the other, and in the middle, Kubernetes works its magic.

    Phase 6: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

    IaC is a way to manage large structures where manual operation is highly ineffective or simply impossible. To go fully IaC, our teams made fundamental changes in the ways we develop, deliver, and maintain our solutions.

    Advantages of IaC

            Control over resources:
          </span>
           The more people have access to the cloud, the more expensive it is to use it. By introducing IaC, we rule out disorderly alterations in the system and prevent wastefulness, thus improving security and gaining firmer control over resources and costs.
    
        </li>
         
        <li

          <span>
            Reproducibility:
          </span>
           IaC is the tool of ultimate reproducibility. By going straight to Terraform, one can avoid repetitive manual work, thus achieving: lower operating costs, higher speed, better coordination within the team, (ideally) fully automated infrastructure deployment.
    
        </li>

          <span>
            Security:
          </span>
           Introduced changes can be tracked, reviewed, and analyzed automatically before delivery. It’s a reliable way to detect and fix vulnerabilities before they can make trouble.
    
        </li>
         
        <li
          class="case_advantages-item"
        >
          <span>
            Reliable documentation:
          </span>
           Documentation effectively stops being relevant once a new change is introduced into the system without being documented. With many changes going on, doc updates get easily forgotten. But if you have code for documentation, this problem is solved. There’s nothing more relevant for understanding a system than code itself. Ideally, what you have in master is what you have in production.
